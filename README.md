# TN Marginal Workers Assessment: Socioeconomic Well-being Analysis

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive socioeconomic analysis of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu, focusing on demographic factors such as age, industrial category, and gender. Using Python and data visualization libraries, it aims to provide insights into the composition of marginal workers to support data-driven policymaking and social welfare interventions.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of marginal workers by age group, gender, and industry category.
- Identify trends, correlations, and disparities in the marginal workforce.
- Create clear, impactful visualizations to communicate findings.
- Provide actionable recommendations for targeted social welfare programs.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on publicly available or government-provided datasets concerning marginal workers in Tamil Nadu. 

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python libraries.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and key metrics.
- Feature engineering to enhance the dataset for deeper insights.
- Statistical analysis to detect significant differences across groups.
- Visualization of data using bar charts and other plot types to highlight trends and inequalities.

## Visualization Techniques
- **Bar charts:** To compare demographic groups such as age, gender, and industry categories.
- Visualization supports understanding of socioeconomic inequalities, gender imbalances, and workforce participation trends.
- Visualizations are designed to be clear and interpretable for policymakers, researchers, and the general public.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib:** Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** Advanced statistical visualizations built on Matplotlib.
